Intro
=====

We will be talking about visualizing your data, with an emphasis on
ggplot2, which is based on the Grammar of Graphics

Goals
=====

-   Participants will learn to think broadly about effective uses of
    visualization


-   Participants will learn of the Cleveland hierarchy and research on
    effective visualization techniques


-   Participants will be introduced to
    [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot/)

    -   [ Lecture notes](Visualization/Lecture_notes.html)

Exercise
========

Construct some (ie., more than one) ggplots using your data. Explain
what you are trying to show and some of the choices that you have made.
You should put your code on the wiki in some form, you don't have to
make it run, but if you don't then you should email us the code and the
data file so we can quickly run it on our machines: make sure that the
code has no local commands (like "setwd") and just runs from beginning
to end. You can test this by clearing your R workspace and running it
from beginning to end.
