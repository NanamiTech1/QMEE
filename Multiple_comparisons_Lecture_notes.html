<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>If we are performing a lot of tests, we want to control the probability of getting a false positive at a higher level than that of individual tests.</p>
<p>We do this by defining <em>families</em> of tests.</p>
<p>It’s not always so clear what a family should be. By convention, a set of pairwise comparisons is defined as a family. Doing the same comparison on a large set of genes is usually defined as a family. Doing several related comparisons is often not defined as a family.</p>
<p>What if we do a large linear model, keeping all the predictors?</p>
<ul>
<li>People usually don’t worry about multiple comparisons if they have one test per parameter, but it’s not so clear why.</li>
<li>If you have categorical variables, one test per parameter covers pre-planned contrasts, but not full pairwise comparisons</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="family-level-error">Family-level error</h1>
<p>We want to define a <em>family</em> of tests, and perform them so that the probability of seeing any significance at all under the null hypothesis is $$&lt;\alpha$$.</p>
<h2 id="bonferroni">Bonferroni</h2>
<p>The simplest approach. Divide the threshold $$\alpha$$ by $$T$$, the number of tests in the family.</p>
<p>Equivalently, multiply each of the P values by $$T$$.</p>
<p>This is very simple, and very conservative, because the total probability of an error under the null hypothesis is $$&lt;\alpha$$.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, the expected <em>number</em> of errors under then null hypothesis is $$\alpha$$.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="holm">Holm</h2>
<p>Sometimes called Bonferroni-Holm, by those who want to cash in on the credibility of Bonferroni.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the lowest P value is significant when multiplied by $$T$$, B-H multiplies the next lowest by $$T-1$$. And so on.</li>
<li>This actually seems to maintain family-level error of $$\alpha$$ even in the worst case. Therefore, there is no reason to use Bonferroni.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hochberghommel">Hochberg/Hommel</h2>
<p>Two similar tests that effectively assume the P values in the family are independent.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that they are conservative if there are <em>positive</em> associations between P values, but suspect when there are <em>negative</em> associations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tukey">Tukey</h2>
<p>A particular family-level test meant to apply to levels of a single factor.</p>
<h1 id="false-discovery-rate-approaches">False discovery rate approaches</h1>
<p>FDR is a relatively new and fairly slick technique. It attempts to control the expected <em>proportion</em> of identified results which are false. FDR provides more power than family-level corrections, but is less conservative.</p>
<h1 id="implementation-in-r">Implementation in R</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>p.adjust()</code> takes a list of P values, and returns a list of adjusted P values
<ul>
<li>It can do Holm, Hochberg and BY (an FDR method), among others</li>
<li><code>pairwise.t.test</code> calls <code>p.adjust</code> to compare a set of factor levels, for example</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>TukeyHSD can be applied to <code>aov</code> objects. <code>aov</code> uses <code>lm</code>, but returns things in a slightly different way</p></li>
<li><code>cld</code> in package multcomp produces “compact letter displays”.
<ul>
<li>$$1^a, 2^{ab}, 3^b, 4^c$$</li>
<li>JD hasn’t tried this yet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
