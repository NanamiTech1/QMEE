Import flow
-----------

Do{
* Make a .tmk
* Check for new super-pages (pages with subpages)
* Make patterns for the super-pages in a perl script and the Makefile
} While super-pages have not been resolved

* Execute the make statement from the .tmk

Cloning
-------

The whole thing is very close to working without local.mk ... but not quite. The pages branch crashes first time it tries to branch. It would probably work if you just cat $PWD into local.mk after you clone. Or if you made in pages more than once ... -$(MAKE); $(MAKE) <branch>.

But I'm going to make myself stop!
