title: Final project
---

Your final project is due on Thursday 20 April at noon. You should discuss and perform a group of statistical analyses. You don't need to write a formal paper, but you should present both the scientific and statistical background clearly. Discuss what choices you made, and if necessary what further statistical steps you should take in the future. The final project is worth two ordinary assignments.
