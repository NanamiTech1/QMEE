title: Final project
---

Your final project is due on Thursday 20 April at noon. You should discuss and perform a group of statistical analyses. You don't need to write a formal paper, but you should present both the scientific and statistical background clearly. Discuss what choices you made, and if necessary what further statistical steps you should take in the future. The final project is worth four (4) ordinary assignments.

## Groups

We have divided you into groups as follows. The star indicates the person whose data we suggest using for the project.

## Getting started

* Make a subdirectory in the projects/ subdirectory of the github repo
	* Use a one- or two-word name that describes the project: e.g., HIV_virulence, biodiversity
	* The name should consist of letters, you can also use numbers or the underscore `_`. Don't use spaces or other characters.

* Add a README.md file to the project. _We will review these over the weekend_. The README.md should
	* Describe your data
	* Describe your scientific question or questions
	* Describe your analysis plans
	* Highlight any questions or issues you have about how to proceed
It is OK to adapt existing text from your assignments, but both partners should go through the text, and the non-starting partner should work to make it clear for outside readers.

* Add your data to the project

* Add a master script, in the style of [Dushoff's script from class](https://github.com/mac-theobio/QMEE_2017/blob/master/dushoff/master.R) (this is in the private repo; you can use the link if you are logged in to github, or you can view it locally in the course repo).

* Start cleaning, coding and analyzing!
	* Again, it's OK to reuse stuff, but you should go over it together before moving on.
