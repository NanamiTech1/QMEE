The web site for Biology 708 https://mac-theobio.github.io/QMEE/index.html

To install the backend:

* Clone this repo
* Type `make pages`

Then you just need to figure out how it all is supposed to work:

* edit .md files
* `make push_site` to send everything to pages/. It is pushed automatically to github; so it should work to view it here, or there. There often takes longer than you would expect to update to the web server.
* To view it here, go to pages subdir after push_site, and open index.html.
