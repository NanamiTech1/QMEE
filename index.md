title: Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution
---

<!--- 

## Current

_For this week_:

* Respond to comments, and clarify your group Readme
* Move your data to your new repo directory
* Make a master script (either .Rmd or .R) that you will build on to give your project a clear flow.
	*  You can look at [the example from class (you will need to be logged in to github to see this)](https://github.com/mac-theobio/QMEE_2017/blob/master/dushoff/master.R)
	* You can also find this script (and the one or two associated scripts that actually exist) in the course private repo, under dushoff/
* _Import_ your data-cleaning procedure to the new repo directory
	* Don't just copy-paste, use this as an opportunity to rethink and rewrite
* Make a script called by master.R (or a section of your .Rmd) that makes one or two pictures that illustrate relevant aspects of your data.
	* This is to help the instructors figure out what's going on and help you.

_Submission_:

* Email us to tell us when it's time to look
* _Tell us_ if you can't submit by Friday at noon
* _Ask us_ if you can't submit by Tue at 9:30
