## Current

### Each week:

* A brief project report by email on Friday; let us know if you have any questions we can address

### Presentations

Mon 3 April and Wed 5 April

* Let us know if you want to request a day or time
* Your presentation should take 10 minutes or less: try to keep it clear and simple
* Don't over-prepare; the presentation should be an informal overview and progress report
	* Don't let the presentation preparation interfere with the actual project
	* Don't even start preparing your presentation until the Wed or Fri before (depending on when you are presenting)

### Final project

* Due Thursday 20 April at noon.

* Discuss and perform a group of statistical analyses. You don't need to write a formal paper, but you should present both the scientific and statistical background clearly. Discuss what choices you made, and if necessary what further statistical steps you should take in the future. 

* The final project is worth four (4) ordinary assignments.

## Course information

* The course meets in LSB-130A:
	*  Mon 10:30-12:20
