Introduction
------------

This week is the introduction to the main statistical part of the
course. We will be grappling with difficult, abstract questions about
what we mean by scientific and statistical inference and about
statistical philosophies.

Time spent grappling with these questions will make you a better
scientist, and will provide you a strong foundation to navigate the
various detailed questions that arise from particular questions and
approaches.

Preparation
-----------

-   Please read the articles below. They should not be too hard to
    get through. Think about your own statistical philosophy and be
    prepared to talk about what statistical inference means to you.
