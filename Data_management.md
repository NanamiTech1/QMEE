Intro
=====

This is the main page for week 2

Goals
=====

-   We will discuss some principles of data management, data flow and
    reproducible research
-   Participants will continue to practice with R, and will examine
    their data and make some products

Resources
=========

-   [Managing projects in R](Managing_projects_in_R.html)
    -   [Co-ordination tools](Co-ordination_tool.html)
-   [Managing data in R](Managing_data_in_R.html)
-   [More bits and pieces](More_bits_and_pieces.html)

Preparation
-----------

In the second hour of Monday's class we will be working to get you set up with Git and Github, following [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/). If possible, before Monday's class:

- Register a GitHub account: you can just go straight to https://github.com to do this (by clicking on either of the green "Sign up" buttons). The one thing you may want to read first is [this advice on picking a GitHub user name](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
- if you're on MacOS, it would be helpful to install XCode ahead of time (https://developer.apple.com/download/).
- it will also be helpful to install the `tidyverse` suite of R packages: withinan R session, type `install.packages("tidyverse")` (*or* you can do this via the package manager window in RStudio).

Exercise
--------

Continue working on your data

-   Examine your data for mistakes, and to make sure you understand the
    R classes
-   Describe what sort of investigations you might do with your data,
    and how you might break it into replicable components
-   Make sure you know how to use `source`, `save` and `load` in R:
    finish a task, and then close R without saving your workspace and
    efficiently redo the task.

Post your description (the second bullet point) to your page on the
wiki.

You can post anything else that you like (data, code). Don't worry if
you can't get it to work, and let us know if you would like help with
that.
