Intro
=====

This is the main page for week 2

Goals
=====

-   Participants will continue to practice with R, and will examine
    their data and make some products
-   We will discuss some principles of data management, data flow and
    reproducible research

Resources
=========

-   [Managing projects in R](Managing_projects_in_R.html)
    -   [Co-ordination tools](Co-ordination_tool.html)
-   [Managing data in R](Managing_data_in_R.html)
-   [More bits and pieces](More_bits_and_pieces.html)

Exercise
--------

Continue working on your data

-   Examine your data for mistakes, and to make sure you understand the
    R classes
-   Describe what sort of investigations you might do with your data,
    and how you might break it into replicable components
-   Make sure you know how to use `source`, `save` and `load` in R:
    finish a task, and then close R without saving your workspace and
    efficiently redo the task.

Post your description (the second bullet point) to your page on the
wiki.

You can post anything else that you like (data, code). Don't worry if
you can't get it to work, and let us know if you would like help with
that.
