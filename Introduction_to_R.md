Preparation
===========

-   Ideally, you should bring a laptop to class. If you can't, we'll
    work something out, but you definitely need access to a computer on
    which you can install and run the software that we will be using for
    the class


-   Please install and run the free (and open-source) program `R` from
    the links at the top of [the Comprehensive R Archive
    Network](http://cran.r-project.org/). (If you have an older version of R installed on your computer (e.g. version < 3.3.0), we strongly recommend that you update it by downloading and installing the latest version.)


-   You should also install and run the free (and open-source) R
    development environment `RStudio` from the Download button at the
    [RStudio web site](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). You want the
    "desktop" version.



Goals
=====

-   An introduction to the R environment, and some basic principles of
    scripting and programming


-   Participants will install and run R, write a script, and read some
    data

Resources
=========

-   Course material
    -   [ Lecture notes](intro_Lecture_notes.html)
    -   [Importing data](Importing_data.html)
    -   [Running R](Running_R.html)


-   The official Introduction to R on the [R manuals
    page](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)


-   [Another introduction to
    R](http://yushan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/mmed/index.php/Introduction_to_R),
    with tutorials (also from JD and associates).

Exercise
========

Input some real data into `R`, and do a substantive calculation using
the data. These can be your own data, or data that you find on the web.
You should provide a text file or spreadsheet, and an R script that
reads it and does the calculation. You should confirm that these work
"independently" before emailing them to us at <bio708qmee@gmail.com>.

Also, a short paragraph about the data would be nice so we can think
about what sort of projects to do in the future.
