## immediate/ASAP

- send e-mail to students pointing them to http://happygitwithr.com and telling them to register for a GH account over the weekend (and maybe send in an "I'm an academic" request for private repos?)

## For next week

- Lecture may need quite a bit of work to be tidier, and less wiki-ish
- add appropriate tidyverse material
- Do Github in second hour! http://happygitwithr.com

## infrastructure

- reorganize directories?

## Weekly schedule

- Lecture on Monday
- Break at 11:20 sharp for the sake of Dushoff
- Assignments due Friday returned by Tuesday
  - We are allowed to be vague about assignment on Monday as long as we are clear by Wednesday

## Managing projects

- We could ask for a course github organization
  - If not, we should spend *one* of our own privates
- People who don't want to share with the course should set up their own github or bitbucket
- Revisit in a couple weeks
- Use Jenny Bryan as a resource (Statistics 545)
   * Use rstudio as the interface â˜¹

## Class info

* Roster is on google docs
* Email list not really set up

## Presentation authoring Workflow

* Can ioslides break intelligently (or at least warn)? (A: so far it looks like we can [make ioslides use scroll bars](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33287556/rmarkdown-ioslides-allowframebreaks-alternative) but not break)
* Prettify CSS? https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/topic10_tablesCSS.html
