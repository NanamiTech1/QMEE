## For next week

* Lecture may need quite a bit of work to be tidier, and less wiki-ish

## infrastructure

- reorganize directories?
- work out markup details for other formats (ioslides etc.)
- work out make/push rules for other formats (ioslides etc.)
- what are we doing about student assignments etc. (GH repos? Dropbox?)

## content

- Make course more tidy.

## presentation

- talk about live-coding
- other ways of increasing interaction?
 - Post-it notes?

## Weekly schedule
- Lecture on Monday
- Break at 11:20 sharp for the sake of Dushoff and/or Flett
- Assignments due Friday returned by Tuesday
  - We are allowed to be vague about assignment on Monday as long as we are clear by Wednesday

## QMEE
* Do we get those emails? Do we have control of the account?

## Managing projects
* We could ask for a course github organization
 * If not, we should spend _one_ of our own privates
* People who don't want to share with the course should set up their own github or bitbucket
* Revisit in a couple weeks
* Should we have a version-control Wednesday?
* Use Jenny Bryan as a resource (Statistics 545)
 * Use rstudio as the interface â˜¹

## Class info
* Roster is on google docs
* Email list not really set up

## Presentation authoring Workflow
* Can IO break intelligently (or at least warn)?
