## QMEE
* Do we get those emails? Do we have control of the account?

## Managing projects
* We could ask for a course github organization
 * If not, we should spend _one_ of our own privates
* People who don't want to share with the course should set up their own github or bitbucket
* Revisit in a couple weeks
* Should we have a version-control Wednesday?
* Use Jenny Bryan as a resource (Statistics 545)
 * Use rstudio as the interface â˜¹

## Class info
* Roster is on google docs
* Email list not really set up

## Presentation authoring Workflow
* Can IO break intelligently (or at least warn)?
