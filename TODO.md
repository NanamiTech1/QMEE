## Weekly schedule

## Managing projects

- We could ask for a course github organization
  - If not, we should spend *one* of our own privates
- People who don't want to share with the course should set up their own github or bitbucket
- Revisit in a couple weeks
- Use Jenny Bryan as a resource (Statistics 545)
   * Use rstudio as the interface â˜¹

## Class info

* Roster is on google docs
* Email list not really set up

## Presentation authoring Workflow

* Can ioslides break intelligently (or at least warn)? (A: so far it looks like we can [make ioslides use scroll bars](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33287556/rmarkdown-ioslides-allowframebreaks-alternative) but not break)
* Prettify CSS? https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/topic10_tablesCSS.html
