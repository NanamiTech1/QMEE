For the first few weeks of the course, there will be a short assignment
every week. You are advised to start on these on Xday (whether
we've said exactly what the assignment is by then or not). We will
typically work on them or talk about them in class on Xday They are
technically due Xday at noon. This is to encourage you to finish
quickly if you can, and move on with your life, not to give you
pressure. We will try to look at them by Xday night. If yours is not
in by the time we finish reading the assignments, there may be a delay
in getting it back to you. If you want to hand in your assignment after
noon on X, talk to us about this first.

Please submit your assignment by email to [bio708qmee@gmail.com](mailto:bio708qmee@gmail.com)
